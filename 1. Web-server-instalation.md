# Nginx Web Server
Setting up NGINX on a VPS (Virtual Private Server) is a common task for hosting websites and applications. Here's a basic guide to get you started:

Connect to your VPS: Use SSH to connect to your VPS. You'll need the IP address, username, and password provided by your hosting provider.

Update package lists: Before installing NGINX, update the package lists to ensure you get the latest version.

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx
sudo systemctl start nginx
``

## Enable NGINX to start on boot: This ensures NGINX start automatically whenever the server is rebooted.

```
sudo systemctl enable nginx
```

Check NGINX status: Verify that NGINX is running without errors.
```
sudo systemctl status nginx
```
Adjust firewall settings: If you have a firewall running, such as UFW, you'll need to allow traffic on port 80 (HTTP) and/or 443 (HTTPS) depending on your configuration.
```
sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full'
```
